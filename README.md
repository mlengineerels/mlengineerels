## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a passion for AI, Natural Language Processing, and MLOps. I specialize in building data-driven solutions that leverage knowledge graphs, large language models, and scalable architectures to solve complex problems. Currently, I'm a Research Assistant at Ceri Lab, University of Missouri, Columbia and as a SoftWare Engineer - Machine Learning at Spectrum.

## ðŸš€ Skills
- **Machine Learning**: Natural Language Processing, Graph Neural Networks, Recommender Systems
- **AI Technologies**: Large Language Models (LLMs), Knowledge Graphs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- **Programming**: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow
- **MLOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, MLflow, Prometheus
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Azure

## ðŸ“ˆ Projects
Here are some of my recent and most impactful projects:

### Scholar Recommendation Pipeline - IEEE TKDE
- Designed to enhance link prediction accuracy by 10% using Graph Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks. This system supports data-driven decision-making for academic collaborations.
- **Technologies**: PyTorch, Graph Neural Networks, Knowledge Graphs.

### Influence Role Recognition and Scholar Recommendation in Academic Social Networks - Accepted & Published in IEEE DSAA
- "ScholarInfluencer," a recommendation system for identifying scholar influencers within interdisciplinary teams in Academic Social Networks (ASN).
- The system combines a classification model with network analysis on a heterogeneous knowledge graph and leverages a large language model (LLM) to recommend scholars and publications.
- Evaluated on datasets like NSF, DBLP, Cora, and CA-HepTh, ScholarInfluencer shows a 13.6% improvement in influence role recognition on the NSF data and a 7% boost in recommendation performance when role recognition is included.

### RAG-QA-System: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Question Answering
- A question-answering system that combines retrieval and generation models to deliver accurate answers based on a knowledge base. Built with PyTorch, sentence-transformers, and BART, deployed with Docker.
- **Technologies**: GNN, RNN, Knowledge Graph Reasoning, MLOps.

### MultiModality
- Develop and maintain large-scale, multimodal datasets for training and evaluating models
- Optimize models for data preprocessing tasks
- Create and run evaluations and benchmark analyses for datasets and models

## ðŸŒ± What I'm Learning
- **MLOps**: Enhancing my skills in model deployment and lifecycle management.
- **Advanced NLP**: Exploring large language models for advanced question-answering systems.
