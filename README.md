### Influence Role Recognition and Scholar Recommendation in Academic Social Networks  
**Published in IEEE - [10.1109/DSAA61799.2024.10722780](https://doi.org/10.1109/DSAA61799.2024.10722780)**  
- Developed "ScholarInfluencer," a recommendation system to identify scholar influencers within interdisciplinary Academic Social Networks (ASN).  
- Combined a classification model with network analysis on a heterogeneous knowledge graph and leveraged a large language model (LLM) to recommend scholars and publications.  
- Evaluated on datasets like NSF, DBLP, Cora, and CA-HepTh, achieving:
  - 13.6% improvement in influence role recognition on NSF data.
  - 7% boost in recommendation performance when role recognition is included.
