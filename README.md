## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a passion for AI, Natural Language Processing, and MLOps. I specialize in building data-driven solutions that leverage knowledge graphs, large language models, and scalable architectures to solve complex problems. Currently, I'm a Research Assistant at Ceri Lab, University of Missouri, Columbia.

## ðŸš€ Skills
- **Machine Learning**: Natural Language Processing, Graph Neural Networks, Recommender Systems
- **AI Technologies**: Large Language Models (LLMs), Knowledge Graphs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- **Programming**: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow
- **MLOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, MLflow, Prometheus
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Azure

## ðŸ“ˆ Projects
Here are some of my recent and most impactful projects:

### RAG-QA-System: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Question Answering
- A question-answering system that combines retrieval and generation models to deliver accurate answers based on a knowledge base. Built with PyTorch, sentence-transformers, and BART, deployed with Docker.
- **Technologies**: GNN, RNN, Knowledge Graph Reasoning, MLOps.

### Scholar Recommendation Pipeline
- Designed to enhance link prediction accuracy by 10% using Graph Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks. This system supports data-driven decision-making for academic collaborations.
- **Technologies**: PyTorch, Graph Neural Networks, Knowledge Graphs, MLflow.

### Real-Time Sentiment Analysis
- Analyzes live social media data to track public sentiment on key issues. Implemented using Transformer-based models and deployed on AWS with Flask for API access.
- **Technologies**: Transformers, Flask, Docker, AWS Lambda.

## ðŸŒ± What I'm Learning
- **MLOps**: Enhancing my skills in model deployment and lifecycle management.
- **Advanced NLP**: Exploring large language models for advanced question-answering systems.
